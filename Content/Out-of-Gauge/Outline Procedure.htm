        <h1>Outline Procedure</h1>
        <p>Outline procedure serves as a subcategory for consignments that exceed the gauge. It is used for  out-of-gauge consignments that do not have the characteristics of any of the other types of exceptional consignments. In 2024, there are two UIC documents for the rules for the procedure: they are set out in the UIC 502-2 Leaflet and IRS 50502-1.</p>
        <p>When an IM applies an outline procedure on their network, it is the RU’s responsibility to carry out the initial inspection of the transport.The RU runs the check for the transport against the:</p>
        <p>•	Criteria set out in the respective UIC document</p>
        <p>•	Criteria specific to respective Infrastructure in order o differentiate the consignment from exceptional consignment procedure</p>
        <p>•	Provisions of the IM's Network Statement</p>
        <p>When the RU conducts an examination of a consignment that exceeds the loading gauge, it is the RU's responsibility to check the availability of an outline profile in the IM’s profile catalogue for the transport criteria.</p>
        <p>If there is no profile in the IM’s profile catalogue, an application for exceptional consignment approval must be submitted to the IM.</p>
        <p>Establishing the permissible outlines of structure gauges for oversized consignments with the largest possible dimensions also requires the constituent values such as safety envelopes and others, at the IM's discretion, which will ensure the safe operation of trains with oversized consignments.</p>
        <p>Providing thorough explanation of the rules and the profiles numbering for this subsystem is well beyond the scope of this project. However the basic principle is explained here . </p>

        <p>Currently the Outline Procedure has been fully introduced (and is biding) in Austria by ÖBB Infra. ÖBB Infra  applies presently the rules of UIC Leaflet 502-2, and is also ready to switch to the new Outline Procedure rules set out in the IRS 50502-1. </p>
        <p>Railway undertakings running trains in Austria are obliged to apply ÖBB Profiles when a consignment meets the criteria laid out in the respective ÖBB Profile, without having to specially contact the Infrastructure Manager. An oversize consignment in the ÖBB Profile is declared for operation when ordering the schedule and by indicating the exact ÖBB Profile Number.</p>
        <p>In Austria Combined Transport trains also run in <strong>ÖBB Profiles</strong> in accordance with the outline procedure for structure gauge. At ÖBB, the Combined Transport route profiles are summarised in 3 groups:</p>
        <p>•	<strong>ÖBB Profile 170</strong>: valid up to <strong class="star">P/C 45</strong> or <strong class="star">P/C 365</strong>.</p>
        <p>•	<strong>ÖBB Profile 171</strong>: valid from <strong class="star">P/C 46</strong> to <strong class="star">P/C 50</strong> or <strong class="star">P/C 366</strong> to <strong class="star">P/C 380</strong>.</p>
        <p>•	<strong>ÖBB Profile 172</strong>: valid from <strong class="star">P/C 51</strong> to <strong class="star">P/C 80</strong> or <strong class="star">P/C 381</strong> to <strong class="star">P/C 410</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Outline procedure on other rail networks in Europe</h3>
        <p class="note1" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;line-height: 1.25em;" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Note: Some other infrastructure managers in Europe have introduced path profiles for out-of-gauge loads, but their rules are binding internally on their networks. Therefore, it is not currently possible for RUs to declare a train in an IM's  outline profile. </p>
        <p>For those infrastructure managers who have not yet begun to codify their networks, railway undertakings cannot expect an imminent transition to simplified procedures for sending exceptional consignments.</p>
        <p class="Information1" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Information: &lt;/b&gt;" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;line-height: 1.25em;"> Due to the huge amount of data that needs to be extracted, elaborated and transformed into an examined profile data, it takes years to codify an IM's entire  railway network.</p>
