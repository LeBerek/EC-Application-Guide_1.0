        <h1>Structure Gauge</h1>
        <p>Railway undertakings are responsible for determining and maintaining the correct rolling stock gauge during transport on an infrastructure manager's network.One of the most frequently asked questions in rail transport is, what is the largest train (consisting  vehicles, or  loaded wagons) that the railway network being considered can accommodate? The answer depends on the network's capacity to accept  trains larger than those internationally interoperable without restrictions, and it derives fully from the gauging methods applied.</p>
        <h2>Infrastructure Gauging Methods</h2>
        <p>Three infrastructure gauging methods are currently applied in Europe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Defined gauging</li>
            <li>Absolute gauging</li>
            <li>Comparative gauging</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Europe has generally adopted a standard UIC approach of defined gauging where infrastructure gauges are defined on the basis of the reference contour and application of associated calculation rules. These UIC gauging methods were originally defined in the 505 series of leaflets. They are currently described in UIC&#160;IRS50505-1, and in the series of European Standard EN 15273.</p>
        <h2>EN 15273 Norm - Defined Gauge Method</h2>
        <p>Defined gauging is a convention between the infrastructure manager and the railway undertaking which is equally important to RUs and rolling stock manufacturers.</p>
        <h3>Who needs to know what?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The infrastructure manager needs a reference profile to know how to maintain and develop their network for safe and efficient operations.</li>
            <li>The railway undertaking needs to know the reference profiles to safely load wagons and to  run vehicles on their wheels.</li>
            <li>A manufacturer of new rolling stock needs to know the reference profiles to which they construct and build new vehicles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The defined gauging calculation process ensures that there is never any contact between vehicle and structure.</p>
        <h3>Calculation methods</h3>
        <p>The defined gauge method described in the norm is split into three main calculation methods:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li> The <b>static</b> method is used on specific, non-interoperable networks.</li>
            <li>The <b>kinematic</b> method is used in Europe mainly on interoperable networks.</li>
            <li>The <b>dynamic</b> method is used on certain networks with the aim of optimizing the space available for sizing non-interoperable vehicles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="Information11" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;line-height: 1.25em;" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Information: &lt;/b&gt;">Infrastructure gauges should not be compared solely  by their profiles since the rules associated which each profile differ from each other.</p>
        <h3>Infrastructure Gauge Types</h3>
        <p>Four types of structure gauges are defined:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Structure Verification Limit Gauge</b> - defines the space not to be encroached upon at any time. It fixes the limit for normal operation. It is used to ensure that structures allow free passage. Consequently, no structure is allowed to penetrate this space at any time.</li>
            <li><b>Structure Installation Limit Gauge</b> - gives the space to be cleared taking into account a maintenance allowance. The allowance is defined according to the line speed and the track quality at the time of the structure installation. The maintenance allowances have defined maintenance levels which are examined to ensure that the minimum clearance shall always be maintained and allow the safe operation of the vehicles.</li>
            <li><b>Structure Installation Nominal Gauge</b> - in addition to maintenance allowances, the structure installation  nominal gauge takes into account the safety allowances and  additional reserved allowances defined for the infrastructure, for example for the running of special consignments, for line speed increase, strong cross winds or aerodynamic effects, and so on.<br /></li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Uniform Structure Gauge</b> - corresponds to a unique contour, evaluated by the infrastructure manager's diagnostics; it includes the most unfavourable situations with significant safety margins.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The EN mandates that the kinematic gauging method is to be used for new and interoperable infrastructure. The infrastructure manager, however, also has a fourth option to create different structure gauges that suit their specific needs. For that reason, they set and apply rules for a Uniform Structure Gauge. </p>
        <p class="Information1" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;line-height: 1.25em;" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Information: &lt;/b&gt;">In Poland, the infrastructure manager has established two uniformed structure gauges. The GPL-1 gauge is used when upgrading or constructing new railway lines or sections of lines for speeds of 200 km/h or less. On the other hand, the GPL-2 gauge is used for modernizing or constructing new railway lines or sections of lines for speeds greater than 200 km/h, and for all new civil engineering structures and platform shelters, regardless of speed. The uniformed structure gauges are to be assessed separately for the section up to a height of 1,170 mm and for the section above it.</p>
        <h2>Structure Gauge Constrictions</h2>
        <p>Constriction may be classified into 4 groups</p>
