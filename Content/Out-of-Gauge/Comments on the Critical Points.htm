        <h1>Comments on the Critical Points</h1>
        <p>Code #19 of the application form is dedicated to remarks on critical points describing load or vehicle. It is also used for loads which have no critical points and for which it is necessary to explicitly state that the loading gauge is not exceeded, as it informs infrastructure managers that the dimensions of a load or vehicle were checked by RU.</p>
        <p>This summary includes the most frequently used declarations that RU must make. Declaration in code #19 may also include other declarations related to cargo dimensions or load class. These declarations may be added individually or as a group of declarations. The number of declarations,  depends on the type of load or vehicle, and also on the type of communication (national versus international).</p>
        <h3>No fouling of the loading gauge</h3>
        <p>For loads on wagons, declare the specified loading gauge profile conformity when you leave empty values in critical points in codes from #12 to #15.</p>
        <p><strong>For example</strong>: Not fouling the loading gauge <a href="http://uic_loading_guidelines-volume_1-01042024.pdf/" title="Start with 8 Table 1: List of the loading gauges " alt="Start with 8 Table 1: List of the loading gauges ">UIC LG Table 1.4</a> when loaded on wagon series Xxxx.</p>
        <p>For vehicles including wagons declare conformity with specified Vehicle Gauge Profile.</p>
        <p><strong>For example: </strong>Does not exceed the vehicle gauge profile G1 in accordance with UIC&#160;505-1 or EN 15273-2 (respectively).</p>
        <h3>Dimensions of payload</h3>
        <p>This declaration serves well when critical points are left empty. <br />For regular cubic loads these dimensions can also be useful for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Transhipment when nett height values of the load are not separately stated in the code #13b.</li>
            <li>A group of loading units such as containers whose type and size codes are insufficient to identify the width of the container, or the group includes various widths of acceptable containers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Connect critical points with a straight line or curve</h3>
        <p>The description of the critical points shown on the front view of load on the wagon or vehicle should allow the RU and IM to reproduce the full contour of the load which will extend beyond the gauge. Such a description of critical points is also necessary to analyse the dimensions of the consignment when loading takes place on wagons with various loading level heights.</p>
        <p>Example of possible variants of points description:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No description, when only one critical point is declared.</li>
            <li>Point G connect with point H, when connecting points reflects the consignment contour.</li>
            <li>Connect lower point B with upper point C with a straight line - when consignment has points stretched over a height range.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Connect point C over D with E with curved line when consignment has round shape.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>A loading tolerance of ... mm is taken into account in the half width (12a / 12b)</h3>
        <p>Each IM has different rules regarding the declaration of cargo dimensions, whether only nett or with tolerances. In addition, in the UIC Loading Guidelines, certain groups of goods have specific loading tolerances. It is a good practice to inform if critical points contain also loading tolerance. The value of tolerance may be, <strong>for example</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Null – Loading tolerance is not included.</li>
            <li>Lateral – 15 mm of centring tolerance is included.</li>
            <li>Upwards – 50 mm tolerance is included for uplift.</li>
            <li>Downwards – wagon sinking tolerance of 25 mm is included.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Centre of gravity</h3>
        <p>RUs presume that, for most loads, once they are loaded onto the wagon, their overall centre of gravity lies centrally at the intersection of the wagon’s longitudinal and transverse planes of symmetry. In such cases, an additional declaration of the centre of gravity location is typically unnecessary.</p>
        <p>It might be required if the shape of the load is complicated or the consignment consists of a number of smaller units, then it is useful to state if the centre of gravity is located centrally on the wagon. </p>
        <p>When the overall location of the centre of gravity of the load is shifted in relation to the longitudinal and transverse symmetrical planes of the wagon, then the location of the centre of gravity must be clearly declared. This should be declared either by means of a code with dimensions, or by description.</p>

        <h3>Peculiarities of payload (load securing)</h3>
        <p>In general, all loads shall be transported as secured in accordance with the rules set in the UIC Loading Guidelines. For loads which are loaded according to the principles of coloured information sheets (pink, blue and yellow) it may be necessary to declare the information sheet number in the application form.</p>
        <p>For  loads for which there are no equivalent methods of alternative securing arrangements to the methods already mentioned, it may be necessary to declare the information sheet number in the application form to the infrastructure manager. What is certain is that "load securing measures to be taken must be agreed between the RUs involved" – UIC LG.</p>
        <p><strong>For example</strong> - declarations for load securing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Rails loading  in accordance with UIC Loading Guideline Annex II, Volume 2, Loading guideline 1.8.3.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Exceptional consignment due to flexible loading unit with a length of more than  36 metres.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
