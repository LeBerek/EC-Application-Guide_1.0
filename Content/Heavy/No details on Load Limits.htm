        <h1>No details on Load Limits</h1>
        <p>For special wagons with specific load tables (e.g. heavy haul wagons) no load table need to be provided.  The complete load table must be provided including the empty load row (if existent).</p>
        <p>Note: Due to underestimation of the time required for elaborating on the topics, this chapter has been retained for information purposes, as a key component of the definition of exceptional consignments. The author expects to complete the missing topics after graduation, while the MadcapFlare licence is still active.</p>
