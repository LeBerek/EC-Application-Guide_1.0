        <h1>Heavy</h1>
        <p>In Europe, facilitating the movement of goods across countries efficiently includes the transport of heavy load consignments. Such transports present unique challenges, as they exceed the standard weights for rail transport. </p>
        <p>In the context of European Rail with a standard gauge of 1435 mm, a consignment is typically considered "<strong>heavy</strong>" when it surpasses the <strong>maximum load capacity of 22.5 tonnes per axle</strong>.</p>
        <p>Vehicles and loaded freight wagons are regarded as heavy load consignments when they:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:xref href="Exceeded Line's Category.htm" alt="Exceeded Line's Category">Exceeded Line's Category</MadCap:xref>, the lowest permissible on the entire route.</li>
            <li>Are loaded in <MadCap:xref href="Excess to Load Limit .htm" alt="Excess to Load Limit within Carrying Capacity">Excess to Load Limit within Carrying Capacity</MadCap:xref> (circle symbol).</li>
            <li>Have <MadCap:xref href="No details on Load Limits.htm">No details on Load Limits</MadCap:xref> marked on them.</li>
            <li>Are on wagons with <MadCap:xref href="Load on Bogies with More Than Three Axles.htm">Load on Bogies With More Than Three Axles</MadCap:xref>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For heavy load consignments, each application submitted for an exceptional consignment should contain a note on exceeded maximum approved axle load or meter load, together with reference to permissible line class.</p>
