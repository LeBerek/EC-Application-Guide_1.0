        <h1>EC Project Scope</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The processing of an authorisation request for the carriage of an exceptional consignment often goes beyond the copy-paste of the data provided by the customer. Many times, the data received needs to be added to or corrected. This project focuses on helping users to efficiently and competently handle the authorisation application process. </p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Verification</strong>: This guide will provide comprehensive instructions on how to verify data related to the goods and the wagons from the documents provided by clients. This includes  inspection of the type of goods, their quantity, weight, dimensions, and other relevant details. The same applies to the inspection of the wagons, including their type, capacity, suitability for the goods, and other relevant details.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Application</strong>: This includes determining the most suitable wagons for specific goods, planning the transport route, and transport organization to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations and safety standards.</li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Exceptional Transport</strong>: The project will focus on exceptional consignments, which involve goods that are oversized, overweight, or require special handling. The application will provide specific guidance for these types of consignments, ensuring that they are transported safely, efficiently, and in compliance with all regulations.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
        <p>With the help of this user guide, users should be able to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Understand how to verify the quality of the data related to goods, wagons and routes.</li>
            <li>Decide whether relevant data is sufficient for an exceptional transport application.</li>
            <li>Ask their client for any data that may be missing.</li>
            <li>Fill the application form effectively and in compliance with all relevant regulations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion<br /></h2>
        <p>This project aims to make the process of planning and executing exceptional consignments more efficient and less prone to errors. Provision of clear guidance on data verification and the provision of comprehensive data in the application for exceptional transport permit, will help users ensure that their consignments are transported safely and efficiently.</p>
