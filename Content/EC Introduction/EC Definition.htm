        <h1>EC Definition</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term49">ERA</MadCap:glossaryTerm>&#160;Report on Facilitation of Combined Transport from 2018 it was noted that currently there is no precise definition for exceptional transport. Two<strong> main pillars</strong> of exceptional consignments: "<strong>out-of-gauge</strong>" and "<strong>heavy</strong>" are recognised by all railways. The <strong>third category</strong> "<strong>other</strong>" contains some common definitions, and some additional definitions which differ in detail from one railway to another. What qualifies as exceptional transport on one railway network may  be considered as regular transport on another.</p>
        <p>Years passed, but  in 2024 the concept of an exceptional consignment still has not been  harmonized. For example in the out-of-gauge pillar, the specific requirements to operate combined transport trains exceeding the loading gauge but not exceeding the codification of the line are still open points in the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term8">EU</MadCap:glossaryTerm> Regulation on <strong>Technical Specifications for Interoperability</strong> (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term23">TSI</MadCap:glossaryTerm>) relating to the operation and traffic management subsystem of the rail system within the European Union.</p>
        <h2>Definition of Exceptional Consignment for the Project</h2>
        <h3>TSI <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term42">OPE</MadCap:glossaryTerm> Working Party (2018)</h3>
        <p>In the above-mentioned report, there is a definition proposal which serves well for the purpose of this project.</p>
        <p>An exceptional consignment is: “A vehicle and/or the load carried which because of construction/design, dimensions or weight does not meet the parameters of the route and requires special authority for the movement and may require special conditions over part or its entire journey”.</p>
        <h2>Other Definitions</h2>
        <h3>International Rules (1435 mm) - <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term41">UIC</MadCap:glossaryTerm>&#160;<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term11">IRS</MadCap:glossaryTerm> 50502:2021</h3>
        <p>Definition of exceptional consignments - summary:</p>
        <p>"An exceptional consignment gives rise to particular technical and/or operating conditions in railway facilities or vehicles for at least one of the parties involved in the carriage of the consignment due to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Its <strong>dimensions</strong>.</li>
            <li>Its <strong>weight</strong>.</li>
            <li>Its <strong>properties</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These conditions must be agreed in advance between all RUs and/or IMs involved"</p>
        <p>This definition has in addition three sub-definitions: <strong>1.1</strong> <MadCap:xref href="../Out-of-Gauge/Out-of-Gauge.htm" alt="Out-of-Gauge Load">Out-of-Gauge Load</MadCap:xref>, <strong>1.2</strong> <MadCap:xref href="../Heavy/Heavy.htm" alt="Heavy">Heavy</MadCap:xref> Load, <strong>1.3</strong> <MadCap:xref href="../Other/Other.htm">Other Exceptional Consignments</MadCap:xref>. This sub-definition structure is reflected in the side menu of the project.</p>

        <p>Within the area in which the CIM applies, the definition below, based on <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term43">UIC leaflet 502-1</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, applies: "a consignment is considered as exceptional, if, because of its external dimensions, its mass or its nature, it gives rise to special difficulties for one of the carriers taking part in the movement taking account of railway installations and wagons and therefore can only be authorized under special technical or operating conditions."</p>
