        <h1>EC Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Exceptional Consignments</h2>
        <p>In rail, <strong>Exceptional Transports</strong> represent the rail industry in a nutshell. Under certain circumstances, a loaded wagon or any type of rolling stock may become an <strong>Exceptional Consignment</strong> (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term37">EC</MadCap:glossaryTerm>). To deal competently with customers ordering exceptional consignments and to efficiently declare transport parameters to the infrastructure managers, you need to be familiar with the numerous aspects of rail transport.</p>
        <h2>Your Knowledge</h2>
        <p>As a standalone professional or a member of an exceptional transport team, you should have extensive knowledge and a thorough understanding of rail.</p>
        <p>You need to understand: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The restrictions imposed by rail infrastructure.</li>
            <li>The rolling stock types and the significance of their key parameters for exceptional transports.</li>
            <li>The wide range of goods and the transport conditions they must meet while being moved by rail.</li>
            <li>The operational difficulties that exceptional consignments may cause.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The User Guide</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Railway Undertaking</strong> (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term6">RU</MadCap:glossaryTerm>)&#160;intending to move an exceptional consignment applies to the <strong>Infrastructure Manager</strong> (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term7">IM)</MadCap:glossaryTerm> for a transport authorisation. The format of the transport authorisation request uses the UIC template with 38 codes, which have been adopted by the vast majority of RUs and IMs.</p>
        <p>This guide is meant to be your handy source of information required for the competent handling of authorisation requests. It is primarily meant to be accessed online via computer, notepad or mobile phone. The vast majority of information here is provided through online (HTML5) output. In addition, for specific use-cases in the application, see also the pdf. file, which you will find in the Handy chapter.</p>

        <h2>The User Guide's Navigation </h2>
        <p>The user guide is split into two main parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Quick frontal access</strong> to an overview of exceptional transport authorisation requests and the four groups of data. Here you will find specific application codes with examples of standard declarations.</li>
            <li><strong>Upper or side menu access</strong> to the chapters. These chapters provide you with the normative background context of <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term41">UIC</MadCap:glossaryTerm>&#160;exceptional consignments. The normative background is supported with examples of dedicated declarations for specific use-case examples.</li>
