        <h1>Route Data</h1>
        <p>The path data specifies the allocation of a railway train over a given route, the sender and receiver of a consignment, the railway undertakings involved, the chosen route, the type of transport organisation, and the party responsible for the transport costs.</p>
        <p>While “route” and “path” might seem similar, they have distinct meanings in the context of railways. A “route” is the actual course or way taken. A “path” is more about the scheduling and allocation of a train on that route. When declaring route data in the application form, keep in mind that the quality of this data  may directly affect the path allocation for a train with an exceptional consignment.</p>
        <p>An insufficiently checked ordered route will, for example, result in the train getting stuck on the route because the train may have to be split due to an unloading ramp beeing too short. Failure to check the parameters of the first or last mile, or the parameters of the siding to or from which the train set is to be delivered, may result as delays in the exceptional transport.</p>
        <p>Any stoppage or delay of a train during the take-over or hand-over is an inconvenience not only for the transport organisers. It is also an inconvenience for other railway undertakings and their clients, due to blocked own resources and the network's capacity. It is worth keeping this in mind when ordering the terms of carriage for an exceptional consignment.</p>
