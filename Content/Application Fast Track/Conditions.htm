        <h1>Conditions</h1>
        <p>Declaration of codes #16–#18 might be required by an Infrastructure manager in national permit applications for goods which while placed on the wagon foul the loading gauge. In applications for international transports these three codes are not mandatory since each infrastructure manager has their own rules on how to calculate oversized exceptional consignments.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#16<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Dynamical supplement [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The value of the supplement for deviations in the horizontal plane is set by an infrastructure manager. These values are published either as a table or calculated from the formula for set height. The value increases with the height of the calculated critical point.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> 102 (value set by PKP&#160;PLK S.A. for the height from 3801 till 3900 mm).</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#17<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Allowance for curves R (250 m) and R (∞ m) [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The values of allowance for curves are declared for (a) the curves with radius R = 250 m and (b) with radius R = ∞, where ∞ is defined as radius &gt; 1000 m. The tables with values are published by infrastructure managers, or can be calculated with formulas. The allowance for the curves is checked separately for the inner and for the outer point. The largest allowance value of the distance between the end axles of vehicles not fitted with bogies or between the bogie centres, or outside of them, is to be declared for the infrastructure manager.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> (a/b) 185 (153 + 32) / 51 (43+8) (values set by PKP&#160;PLK S.A. for the wagon with bogie centres distance of 14200 mm).</p>

        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#18<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Width of the needed space from the middle of the track for R (250 m) and R (∞ m) [mm]</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The value of the needed space is calculated as the sum of the values declared in codes #16 and #17, and is presented separately for (a) curves with radius R = 250 m and (b) curves with radius R = ∞, where ∞ is defined as radius &gt; 1000 m.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> (a/b) 287 / 153 (calculation based on values binding for PKP&#160;PLK S.A infrastructure manager.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>The next two codes are optional. They are only used in situations arising from the code description. In most applications they may be omitted. Some infrastructure managers, omit these codes in their application templates.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#25 <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Customs station</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>This is only required if customs are handled at neither the frontier station nor the destination station.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> State exact name of the station.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#26 <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Transhipment port - harbour loading quay</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For larger ports make sure to direct the train to the right group of unloading tracks. Name the harbour loading quay where the train will be loaded or off-loaded.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> Gdansk Port Polnocny, Rudowy (ore) quay.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>Application declarations for the code #29 greatly vary in included details because they depend on the type of railway vehicle and of goods being transported. Therefore, this code contains summary descriptions which are sufficient to declare parameters of a wagons with the goods.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#29<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Forwarding conditions</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The forwarding conditions remarks refer  to the payload characteristics that affect how the consignment or a vehicle must be prepared for the transportation and how to examine the route so the transport can occur. For example, remarks may include information on payload earthing, on personnel with route knowledge or the knowledge of vehicle operation, on vehicle's or consignment’s or both position in a train (behind the locomotive, or at the end of the train). Other restrictions may include a ban on wagon group separation or ban on propelling, hump shunting or passing over humps.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> include wagon at the end of the train, wagon group separation forbidden.</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#30<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Direction of travel - label O</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Direction of travel matters in two situations. For road vehicles carried on wagons, it is important that they arrive at the station in the right direction of travel, so that they can drive off the wagon. In such a case the direction of travel is described here, and label O is not used. For goods that stick out more to one side of the wagon than the other, label O is used to mark the points on the cargo that stick out. Find out more on the sticking out points, namely the <MadCap:xref href="../Out-of-Gauge/Critical Points.htm">Critical Points</MadCap:xref>.<br /><strong>For example:</strong>Take over at the border in Arnoldstein (AT) / Tarvisio (IT) facing forward.<br /></p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <p>Although the next two codes are not required, we suggest declaring them. This facilitates the search for similar transport conditions and helps in the queuing of requests when multiple requests are being agreed at once.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#31<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Previous forwarding numbers</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>If you prolong  authorisation with carriage conditions for  the same type of cargo and wagon set, and on the same route but for the next yearly schedule, then name the previously used approval numbers for the transport. This information can be helpful for the infrastructure managers.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> DB Bza _____, CZ MZ______.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>
        </MadCap:dropDown>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#32<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Loading date, delivery date</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Declare the loading date either as the exact date, or refer to the calendar week, or month when the transport is planned to begin. This information helps the infrastructure manager to better plan their work and allocate their resources. As practice shows, the delivery date is of less importance. When agreeing conditions for a wagon or a vehicle that is ready to  be reinstated en route (after the detection of a faulty state), inform the IM accordingly.<br /><strong>For example: </strong>From 12.08.2024, from the 17/18 week 2024.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> Stopped at station____, ready to be reinstated.</p>
            </MadCap:dropDownBody>

        <p>Code 33, is recalled for information purposes only, as it is occasionally declared in exceptional consignment applications.</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>#33<MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Inspection requirement - trust based agreement</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In the application, declare whether the transport is to be handed over or  taken over in trains which are subject to a trust-based agreement (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term34">ATTI</MadCap:glossaryTerm>). Include information where the train inspection is required and by which entity.<br /><strong>For example:</strong> for yes – train is a subject to ATTI agreement, inspection conducted at station Paskov by PKP Cargo International; for no – at station Petrovice an inspection is required by CD Cargo.<br /></p>
