                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Is the container length code sufficient to determine the out-of-gauge encroachment?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Not really. Out-of-gauge size is determined based on, wagon height and  the combination of the container width and height above the top of the rail. Therefore, for loading gauge compatibility always check the declared dimensions of the set consisting of the container on the wagon. Otherwise, your application for the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term37">EC</MadCap:glossaryTerm> permit will be returned to you with a request to fill in the missing parameters.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot> Is it sufficient to declare the container as <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term38">HC</MadCap:glossaryTerm> without indicating the wagon type?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Not really. High Cube describes the container's height 9.5 feet (2896 mm). It does not refer to the actual container width. When one container is loaded on wagons with different geometrical characteristics and loading plane heights,it will manifest fixed width but with various heights in the loading gauge profile. In addition, a HC container may have various widths. Therefore, it is crucial to declare both the container's height and width, along with all wagon types intended for the transport.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For ISO&#160;Type 1 containers with  2438 mm, it is enough to declare the 4-character code of the type and size of loading unit. For wider containers,in addition to the type and size code declaration the maximum width declaration is also required. For <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term10">CT</MadCap:glossaryTerm> Trains  additional information is required on yellow codification plate with C profile's number.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>For a cuboid with constant width and height it is sufficient to mark just the maximum dimensions. For cuboid shapes of which the upper part is narrowed for the gauge compliance, additional declaration of the exact dimensions of the tapered corners is required.</p>

        <p>Frequently asked questions mainly related to loads on wagons</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>How to declare the interoperability marks on wagons?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>The declaration of RIV or RIC signs without additional descriptions is sufficient. When declaring TEN signs, specify if the wagons also have GE or CW signs. In the case of CW wagons, ask in addition for the wagon gauge marking. For wagons with a derogation plate or an authorisation plate, ask for the content of these plates in order to determine compatibility with the rail networks to which you are directing the wagon.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>How to declare multiple loading units on various series of wagons?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In one application form it is possible to declare more than one type of a consignment on one type of wagon. You enter the required parameters of all wagons intended for the transport, and name the consignment type. If the consignments are out-of-gauge, you create multiple tables with dimensions of the load and wagon in addition. Some IMs accept that the RU creates a common outline for all loads on all types of wagons in a train. Drawing up a train outline requires experience. If you are not sure how to do it, and do not know anyone who can help you, do not create an outline. Declare the dimensions individually.</p>

        <p>Frequently asked questions mainly related to routes</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot> Is it sufficient to indicate the DIUM station code to specify the destination station?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>It helps to declare the DIUM station code in the application, but it the case of larger stations it might be challenging to determine  which siding, terminal, or quay the consignment is destined for. In such a case specify the exact area at a larger station where the wagon with the consignment is destined.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>What if the station to which the consignment is sent does not have a DIUM code?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>This situation might be challenging for your commercial colleagues who do freight calculations. In such cases always contact them and make sure which station is preffered instead as a commercial destination. Advise other participating RUs accordingly on the situation.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>When can I use the notation "to various destination stations"?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>When you’re sending a consignment that will only take one specific route on your manager’s network, but will go to various stations on another network, it’s useful to declare it as “to various destination stations”. Also, list these stations under code #22. If you’re unsure of the other stations, but presume the consignment has the potential to be sent to other foreign stations, you can also label it as “to various stations” without additional stations list. In this case, keep a separate record of any additional destination stations you add. Just make sure that your infrastructure manager allows this solution.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Do I always have to specify a preferred route?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In general, it is a good idea to declare a preferred route. Keep in mind that block trains might have different routes than regular trains. Declaring the preferred route assures that train drivers have the route knowledge. Preferred route for wagon groups must include routing through marshalling stations. Note that in the case of very large consignments, it is better not to specify the preferred route in the application, because in such a case the infrastructure manager decides the way  the train can take.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>How do I apply for two border crossings in one application?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>When you apply to another RU abroad using an entire network permit, then in code #23 you list all commercially agreed border crossings in one application. Note that on some IM networks this option is limited to different border crossings within one regional area (e.g. DB&#160;InfraGO).</p>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>What if the shipment is exceptional only in the country of shipment?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>In such a case you need to apply for an IM's permit only in the country of origin. You do not need to inform the other participating RUs before hand over takes place. Keep in mind that in case of a return path, more RUs will be involved in the EC application process, despite it being exceptional in just one IM's network.</p>

            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Our recommendation: add a fictive estimated time of departure. State the date two or three weeks in advance, so the IM can plan his work-load capacity accordingly.</p>
