        <h1>Load Overhang</h1>
        <p>Rigid goods which overhang over the coupling zone may swing out further than the wagon body when the wagon runs on curved tracks. This is why it is <strong>necessary to reduce the width of the load overhang</strong>  to take the load's protrusion into account when examining a consignment’s conformity with the requested route.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Load's overhang</b>, as such, <strong>is not a reason for</strong> treatment as <strong>exceptional consignment</strong>.<br />You deal with a rigid long consignment when the load:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is loaded on one wagon.</li>
            <li>Protrudes over the:<ul><li> Maximum loading length.</li><li>Coupling zone. </li></ul></li>
            <li> <strong>Does not exceed the length of 10 m</strong>, when it's overhang is measured longitudinally from the bogie pivot axis to the front or the end edge of consignment.</li>
            <li>Is transported with protection wagon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, in such cases always check:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> That <strong>the load width restrictions</strong> which are set in UIC Loading Guidelines Tables are observed.</li>
            <li><strong>The larger value of the overhang</strong>, when the load overhangs at both ends of the wagon.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The axle load values</strong> especially when the load's centre of gravity is displaced  in relation to the central intersection of the three axes of symmetry of the wagon under consideration.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is essential to carry out the above checks since these loads, due to their dimensions of length and width and because of their shifted centre of gravity, <strong>may become reasons for exceptional consignments</strong>, as <strong>out-of-gauge</strong> or <strong>heavy transports</strong>.</p>
