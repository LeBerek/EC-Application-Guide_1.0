        <h1>Handover to Ferry</h1>
        <p>Most goods shipped by rail to ports are routed to harbour loading quays or port terminals, depending on their type and the transfer method to the ship. Some European ports accept also train-ferry service. In both cases of exceptional consignment trains going to a port, it is necessary to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ascertain to which specific tracks in the port area the train with the exceptional consignment is to be directed.</li>
            <li>Inquire whether exceptional consignment approval is also granted by the port infrastructure managers for this type of consignment.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>When consignments that are to be transshipped to a ferry, do not meet the regulations of General Contract of Use of wagons (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term33">GCU</MadCap:glossaryTerm>), Appendix 14, Part A, they constitute another type of exceptional consignment. </p>
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Rail-ferry  transfer locations and specific rules are listed in <a href="https://gcubureau.org/wp-content/uploads/Contract/2024/20240101_A14_EN.pdf" title="GCU Annex - conditions in 14 Part A" alt="GCU Annex - conditions in 14 Part A">Part A of GCU&#160;Annex 14</a>. Specific ports and ferries have their individual characteristics of train access and therefore certain restrictions that wagons must fulfil to be accepted onto a ferry. Observe wagon marking:</p>
