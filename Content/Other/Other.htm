        <h1>Other Exceptional Consignments</h1>
        <p>While out-of-gauge and heavy exceptional consignments are well-defined and straightforward, the third category of<strong> Other Exceptional Consignments</strong> is, at first sight, more elusive. It encompasses a diverse range of goods and vehicle qualities that defy a single, meaningful common description. </p>
        <p>Some of these consignments pose unique challenges due to the nature of the goods and the  method of loading, arrangement and securing when on the wagons. Another distinct aspect focuses on the authorization conditions for a wide range of vehicles running or towed on their own wheels.</p>
        <p>Explore the Other Exceptional Consignments in detail. Each topic provides you with a thorough understanding of the specific reasons for the <strong>"other"</strong> category and how to best deal with each case:</p>
