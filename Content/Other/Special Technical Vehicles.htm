        <h1>Special Technical Vehicles</h1>
        <p>A special technical vehicle is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self-propelled railway vehicle with a nominal weight exceeding 20 t.</li>
            <li>Self-propelled railway vehicle, irrespective of its weight, with a self-propulsion enabling the railway vehicle to reach a speed exceeding 10 km/h.</li>
            <li>Towed railway vehicle.</li>
            <li>Control car designed for:<ul><li> Construction</li><li>Maintenance</li><li>Repair or reconstruction of a railway.</li><li>Checking the condition of a railway.</li><li>Dealing with the consequences of emergencies.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>IRS&#160;50502 Definition</h3>
        <p>“Vehicles running on their own wheels with special technical features among the others, like civil engineering machines that are authorised for carriage only with special operational treatment.”</p>
        <h3>Use cases</h3>
        <p>Information in this topic applies to special technical vehicles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Authorised for carriage only with special operational treatment.</li>
            <li>Delivered to and from the tests, during subsystems certification phase run through designated bodies for conformity assessment.</li>
            <li>Transported as a subject to contract between the vehicle's manufacturer and consignee before being put into service.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Geometrical characteristic</h3>
        <p>Technical Vehicles are often longer than standard wagons. Some of them have longer distances between bogie pivots than standard wagons. Some vehicles are built from modules with various distances between the bogie pivots and single axles where applicable. Modular vehicles may consist of a tractive unit and a group of wagons forming an inseparable vehicle group.</p>
        <h3>Line Class</h3>
        <p>Unlike wagons, such vehicles have no grid with load limits in classes marked on them. Technical vehicles have marking of own mass and maximum mass of loaded or equipped vehicle. A sign of the vehicle's compatibility with railway line's load class is marked on machines built in accordance with <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term23">TSI</MadCap:glossaryTerm>s. Ascertain with the manager whether he accepts the indication of only the class to which the vehicle has been tested.<br /><strong>For example</strong>: Class of railway line C2.</p>
        <p>Note that for vehicles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Authorised for operation on a few infrastructure networks the values of approved class of railway line may differ depending on the authorisation tests which were run during the vehicle authorisation phase.</li>
            <li>Built from various construction modules rely on axle load value established by the manufacturer or entity in charge of maintenance (<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="RailGlossary.Term54">ECM</MadCap:glossaryTerm>) because applying simple maximum load calculation formula is insufficient.</li>
        </ul>
